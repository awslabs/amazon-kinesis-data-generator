                <p class="lead">The Amazon Kinesis Data Generator (KDG) makes it easy to send data to Kinesis Streams or
                    Kinesis Firehose. Learn how to use the tool and create templates for your records.</p>

                <h2 id="configAccount" class="page-header">Configure Your AWS Account</h2>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> Setting up the Kinesis Data Generator (KDG) in an AWS account will create a set of
                    Cognito credentials.
                    Users who can authenticate with those credentials will be able to publish to all Kinesis Data
                    Streams and Kinesis Data Firehoses in the
                    account. After executing the setup below, you may change the IAM roles that are created to restrict
                    permissions to publish to
                    specific streams or firehoses.
                </p>
                <h3 id="cognitoUser">Create an Amazon Cognito User</h3>

                <p>Before you can send data to Kinesis, you must first create an <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" target="_blank">Amazon Cognito</a>
                    user in your AWS account with permissions to access Amazon Kinesis. To simplify this process,
                    an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">Amazon Lambda</a> function and
                    an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">Amazon CloudFormation</a>
                    template
                    are provided to create the user and assign just enough permissions to use the KDG.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Amazon Cognito is not supported by CloudFormation, much of the setup is done in a Lambda
                    function.
                    The source code for the function can be downloaded from <a
                        href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-data-generator/raw/mainline/setup/datagen-cognito-setup.zip">here.</a>
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                    The CloudFormation template will create the following resources in your AWS account:
                <ul>
                    <li>An IAM role that gives the Lambda function permission to create Cognito resources.</li>
                    <li>An IAM role that is assigned to authenticated Cognito users. This role has only enough
                        permission to use the KDG.</li>
                    <li>An IAM role that is assigned to unauthenticated Cognito users. This role has only enough
                        permission to create Cognito analytics events.</li>
                    <li>A Lambda function to bootstrap the Cognito Lambda install from GitHub</li>
                    <li>A Lambda function to set up Cognito.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cognito Lambda function will create the following resources in your AWS account:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Cognito User Pool.</li>
                    <li>A Cognito Federated Identity Pool.</li>
                    <li>A Cognito User, with the username and password specified by you when you created the
                        CloudFormation stack.</li>
                    <li>The necessary relationships between the roles, users and pools.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Create the CloudFormation stack by clicking the button below. It will take you to the AWS
                    CloudFormation console and start the stack creation wizard. You only need to provide
                    a Username and Password for the user that you will use to log in to the KDG. Accept the defaults for
                    any other options presented by CloudFormation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that the CloudFormation Template below is currently supported in the following regions:

                    <br>
                    In addition to the above regions, <b>GovCloud</b> is also supported by manually importing the
                    CloudFormation template in the following regions:

                <ul>
                    <li>us-gov-east-1 (Ohio/OSU)</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    For manually installing KDG by CloudFormation:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        download the template from <a

                <h3 id="cfnOutput">Access the KDG</h3>
                <p>
                    After the CloudFormation stack has been successfully created, you will need to use a special URL
                    to
                    access the
                    KDG. CloudFormation creates this URL as part of the stack generation, and you can find it
                    in the Outputs section of the CloudFormation stack.</p>
                <p>
                    To find the URL, choose the CloudFormation stack, and then choose the Outputs tab as shown
                    below.
                    Simply bookmark this URL in your browser for
                    easy future access to the KDG.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h2 id="template" class="page-header">Record Template</h2>

                <p>The KDG can generate records using random data based on a template you provide. In the Record
                    Template textarea, provide a template that represents a single record.
                    The KDG will create a unique record based on the template, replacing your templated record with
                    actual data. The record template can be of any type: json, csv, or unstructured.
                    Because of this, there is no validation of the data before it is sent to Kinesis.</p>
                <p>The KDG extends <a href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/">faker.js</a>, an open source random
                    data
                    generator. For full documentation of the items that can be "faked" by faker.js, see the <a
                        href="https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/blob/master/Readme.md">faker.js documentation.</a>
                </p>
                <h3 id="templateExamples">Example Templates</h3>
                <p>Data elements in a teamplate that need to be replaced for each record use moustache syntax (i.e.
                    enclosed in double curly-braces {{ replace.this }} ). Consider the following data record,
                    representing somebody's first name,
                    last name, age, and IP address:</p>
                <pre>
John,Doe,42,127.0.0.1
            </pre>
                <p>The template to generate records of this type:</p>
                <pre>
{{name.firstName}},{{name.lastName}},{{random.number(70)}},{{internet.ip}}
            </pre>
                <p>Records can be represented in any data structure, such as JSON:</p>
                <pre>
{
    "sensorId": 40,
    "currentTemperature": 76,
    "status": "OK"
}
            </pre>
                <p>In this template, assume that the "status" can be only one of three items (OK, WARN, FAIL). Also
                    assume that we want the temperature range to be a random value between 10 and 150. The template
                    for
                    this would look like:</p>
                <pre>
{
    "sensorId": {{random.number(50)}},
    "currentTemperature": {{random.number(
        {
            "min":10,
            "max":150
        }
    )}},
    "status": "{{random.arrayElement(
        ["OK","FAIL","WARN"]
    )}}"
}
            </pre>
                <h3 id="additionalFunctionality">Additional Templating Functionality</h3>
                <p>The KDG supports several other templating features, in addition to the native templating provided
                    by
                    faker.js.</p>
                <h4>Current Date and Time</h4>
                <p>You can insert the current date and time into each record by including a date.now and date.utc
                    items
                    in your record template. The KDG uses the <a href="http://momentjs.com">moment.js</a> library
                    for
                    datetime formatting. Details for creating an appropriate format string for your use case can be
                    found in the <a href="http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/">moment.js documentation</a>.
                    Several
                    examples are shown here:</p>
                <pre>
                {{date.now}}                                     // 2014-09-08T08:02:17-05:00
                {{date.now("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a")}}    // Sunday, February 14th 2010, 3:25:50 pm
                {{date.now("ddd, hA")}}                          // Sun, 3PM
                {{date.now("DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z")}}           // 14/Jul/2009:20:12:22 -0700
            </pre>
                <pre>
                {{date.utc}}
                {{date.utc("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a")}}
                {{date.utc("ddd, hA")}}
                {{date.utc("DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z")}}
            </pre>

                <h4>Weighted Array Element</h4>
                <p>Sometimes you don't want randomness to be completely random. You might want to to choose elements
                    from an array, but you want the randomness to be weighted such that over time, each element is
                    chosen a certain number of times, relative to other elements in the array.
                    To accomplish this, use random.weightedArrayElement. It takes a JSON object as input, with that
                    JSON
                    object containing two attributes: weights, and data. Each attribute contains a single array. The
                    data array contains the data
                    from which you want the function to choose, and the weights array contains items representing
                    the
                    percentage that each corresponding element in the data array should be chosen.</p>
                <pre>
{{random.weightedArrayElement(
  {
    "weights": [0.3,0.2,0.5],
    "data": ["cat","fish","dog"]
  }
)}}
            </pre>
                <h2 id="template" class="page-header">Record Send Rate</h2>
                <p>The KDG can use one of two different strategies for calculating the send rate of messages:
                    Constant
                    or Periodic. Select between the two by choosing the "Constant" or "Periodic" tab.</p>

                <h3 id="templateExamples">Constant Data Rate</h3>
                <p>In "Constant" mode, the KDG sends the same number of records each second.</p>

                <h3 id="templateExamples">Periodic Data Rate</h3>
                <p>In "Periodic" mode, the KDG sends a variable number of records each second. The rate varies by
                    hour-of-day and day-of-week. This allows for simulation of periodic data. The record send rate
                    is
                    pseudo-random. The actual value is chosen along a guassian distribution centered on Mu with a
                    standard deviation of the value provided by Sigma (you can specify a different Mu and Sigma for
                    each
                    hour of each day of the week).</p>
                <p>If "Enable Linear Smoothing" is selected, Mu and Sigma will be adjusted linearly between adjacent
                    hours, with the actual provided values for Mu and Sigma used at the top of the hour and
                    transitioning to the next hour linearly.</p>
                <p>If "Lock to Real Time" is selected, data will be generated every second - similar to the
                    "Constant"
                    mode. If "Lock to Real Time" is deselected, the KDG will prompt you for start and end datetimes
                    and
                    will generate data for each second between those start and endtimes in "ticks." The number of
                    seconds of data that is generated in each "tick" is the value in "Seconds of data per tick" and
                    the
                    data generation thread will yield for "Wait time between ticks" (milliseconds) between each tick
                    (to
                    allow other browser processes, including the Kinesis send thread, to execute). In this "Unlocked
                    to
                    real time" mode,
                <pre>{{date.simTime}}</pre> will be evaluated in the template as the currently-simulated time (as
                opposed to the wall-clock time that will be returned by {{date.now}}). This is especially useful for
                generating bulk datasets as quickly as your browser can (as opposed to generating them in real
                time).
